% Problem 1
\section{Problem 1 --- 3G (UMTS) Security}

\subsection{Discuss the new infrastructure requirements in moving from a GSM
            network to UMTS.}

In GSM, the main architectural components are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:prob1a}.
They are the Mobile Station (MS); the Base Station Subsystem which consists of Base Station
Controller (BSC) and the Base Transceiver Station (BSS); and the Network Subsystem
which consists of the Home Location Register (HLR), the Visitor Location Register
(HLR), the Equipment Identity Register (EIR), the Authentication Centre (AC), and
the Mobile Service Switching Center (MSC).

In UMTS, the main architectural components are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:prob1b}.
They are the User Equipment (UE); the Radio Access Network (RAN) which is composed of multiple
base stations;

%Problem 2
\section{Problem 2 --- LTE Security}

\subsection{Illustrate the improvements of LTE security over UMTS security.
            Give detailed explanations.}

%Problem 3
\section{Problem 3 --- IEEE 802.15 for WPAN Security}

Alice is using GSM cellular network to communicate with her friends.

\subsection{What is the hopping rate in Bluetooth and how many bits are
            transmitted in one slot transmission?}


\subsection{Which 802.11 LAN standards will Bluetooth interfere with?}


\subsection{What is the reason for a lower speed/lower power WPAN standard
            such as IEEE 802.15.4?}
